# Project Testing

## Jest Automated Testing
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. 
- Jest aims to work out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects.

To run tests in the terminal, type (without the `.test.js` extension):

`npm test -- filename`

## Manual Testing

**The site was built, tested and validated on the [Chrome browser](docs/pictures/chrome.jpg) only.**

### Supported Screen Sizes and Browsers

No framework was used for building the site, only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript - see the [supported browsers for HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_html_browsersupport.asp).
    - Chrome
    - Firefox
    - Safari
    - Opera
    - Edge

* Devices supported:
    - Mac
    - Windows
    - Android
    - iOS

* See the [default breakpoints](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_media_query_breakpoints.asp) provided by W3 Schools for responsive building. Breakpoints are a representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions—they don’t specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device. 

    | Breakpoint               | Dimensions |
    | ------------------------ | ---------- |
    | Extra small              | <600px     |
    | Small                    | ≥600px     |
    | Medium                   | ≥768px     |
    | Large                    | ≥992px     |
    | Extra large              | ≥1200px    |

### Console Errors


### Code Validation
* HTML - No errors and 2 warnings were detected by [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) for pages:
    - [index.html PDF report](docs/testing/w3c-validation/html-errors.pdf) : 5 errors, 6 warnings
    - [index.html PDF report](docs/testing/w3c-validation/html-errors-solved.pdf) : 0 errors, 2 warnings
    Warnings are caused by 2 headings where JavaScript would create the text content. Added aria-labels for accessibility - see WAVE section below.

* CSS - No errors or warnings were detected by [Jigsaw (W3C)](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) for:
    - [style.css PDF report](docs/testing/w3c-validation/w3c-css.pdf)

### Lighthouse
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) is an automated tool for improving the quality of web page. It checks the current webpage for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO. 

The desktop audit scored 100 across the four features for all pages. Here is a typical summary:
<h2 align="left"><img src="docs/pictures/courses-summary-desktop.jpg"></h2>

The mobile audit scored >90 across the four features for all pages. Here is the lowest-scored summary:

### Web Accessibility Evaluation
[WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://wave.webaim.org/) "help authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of web content. Our philosophy is to focus on issues that we know impact end users, facilitate human evaluation, and to educate about web accessibility."

Initially, the WAVE detected:
* 0 contrast errors - colour palette passed accessibility tests
* 6 errors:
    - 3 missing form labels - where placeholder text was used instead of labels
    - 2 empty headings - where headings would be generated by JavaScript for game over and email submission
    - 1 empty link - where a link was attached to an icon rather than text
+ [WAVE Report 1](docs/testing/wave/wave1-errors.jpg) : Errors
+ [WAVE Report 2](docs/testing/wave/wave2-errors.jpg) : Errors

* Errors solved by adding aria-labels to the: 
    - form inputs
    - empty headings
    - a tag of footer link
+ [WAVE Report 1](docs/testing/wave/wave1-solved.jpg) : Errors Solved
+ [WAVE Report 2](docs/testing/wave/wave2-solved.jpg) : Errors Solved
